"""Link-driven recharge archetype + routing policy (Phase 52.6, ISS-053).

The policy layer that decides whether a unit of managed/incidental recharge
becomes a *personal* (recoverable) groundwater credit on a parcel, or flows to
the GSA-level basin pool. It is a PURE decision layer — no ledger writes, no
Decimal math, no engine state — so the rest of Phase 52.6 is thin wiring around
these two functions.

The decision falls out entirely of a parcel's own links, sorting it into one of
three archetypes:

* ``CONJUNCTIVE`` — has a well. Banks surplus underground and pumps it back, so
  its recharge is a personal credit it recovers itself.
* ``FLOOD_MAR`` — no well, but has a crop (typically with surface delivery).
  Contributes to the basin-wide pool; recovers nothing itself.
* ``BASIN`` — no well, no crop (a fallow recharge basin). Dedicated infiltration
  straight to the basin pool.

ISS-053 is the bug this prevents: a surface-only parcel (e.g. MER-APN-031 — a
point of diversion and a crop, but no well) was receiving a per-parcel
groundwater recharge credit it has no well to pump against. The single
discriminator for personal-vs-pool is therefore ``has_well``: CONJUNCTIVE routes
personal, BASIN and FLOOD_MAR route to the pool. The three-way label exists for
reporting clarity, but the routing predicate stays robust even on odd link
combinations (crop + no surface + no well is still pool, never personal).
